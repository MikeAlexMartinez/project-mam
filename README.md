This is the code for my personal website which will eventually host my personal portfolio, my blog, and will allow people to contact me directly throught the webpage.

The homepage of this website should meet the following criteria or 'user-stories' as defined by
FreeCodeCamp.

- User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

- User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

- User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

- User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.


To Do List:
- Add tests for all API endpoints
- create screenshots and for projects so far.
- create gulp task and uniform format to bring in projects to home page automatically.
